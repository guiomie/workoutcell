Workoutcell was an attempt to build a platform for connecting atheltes and coach in cardio based sports. The project was abandonned, it is also my first web project, this means both server-side and client-side code is horrible. The platform still supports the following features:

1. Adding/Removing training events in a calendar
2. Creation of workout cells (a circle of friends)
3. Adding training events for a cell
4. Notification events (friend request, coaching request, event request)
5. Creation of running/cycling courses on a map (google map javascript sdk)
6. Attaching courses to training events to share
